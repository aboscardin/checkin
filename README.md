## About
checkin was an internal effort to replace an obsolete visitor check-in system. The effort was killed when we learned that the API for checking first and last names against restricted persons lists is $10,000 per year - $8,000 more expensive than outsourcing the entirety of visitor check-in to a third party service.
- Chunks of the app are unfinished
- Designed for a stationary iPad
